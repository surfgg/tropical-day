# Tropical Day

Tropical Day is an experimental light theme by Surf. It's built on the fantastic [Quiet Light theme](https://github.com/onecrayon/theme-quietlight-vsc) from Ian Beck. It's intent is to be more balanced in it's contrast, more distinct in it's approach to a light theme, and more comfortable for regular usage.

Feel free to offer suggestions, ideas or feedback via Issue or PR! Thanks for dropping by, and hopefully trying this theme out.

## Officially tested for:

* HTML
* CSS / LESS / SCSS
* JavaScript
* PHP
* Python
* Markdown

## Known issues

* No background colors (see [VSC issue #3429](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3429))
* PHP coloration in HTML attribute strings is currently borked
* SCSS commas in selectors (and some tag names) are uncolored (no syntax zone)
* HTML `<style>` tag attribute equal signs are miscolored (no syntax zone)
